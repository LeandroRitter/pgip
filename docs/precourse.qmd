## Suggested readings

The first sessions consist of lectures that aim to introduce concepts
and theory from population genetics

[Population genomics in practice](slides/pgip/index.qmd) provides a
quick overview of population genomics. Although not required, it is
recommended to briefly go through the following papers that will be
discussed in the lecture:

- @fuller_PopulationGeneticsCoral_2020 (most important)
- @johri_RecommendationsImprovingStatistical_2022

[Population genetics](slides/foundations/index.qmd) introduces the
foundations of population genetics. This lecture contains a lot of
material and we strongly recommend you review the slides to be fully
prepared for the lecture. See [notes on
usage](slides/index.qmd#a-note-on-usage) for instructions how to view
slides.

## UPPMAX account

You will need an [uppmax account](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/) to run
some of the exercises. You can apply for an account
[here](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/getting-started/applying-for-a-user-account/).

### Tutorials

Look at <https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/>, in particular
<https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/guide--first-login-to-uppmax/>
for information on how to connect to and work on uppmax.

## Software installation{#sec-software-installation}

::: {.callout-important}

Instructions will be updated when a full list of required programs are
available.

:::

In case there are issues with UPPMAX we ask you to prepare a local
backup compute environment on your computer. We will use the
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package manager to install
necessary requirements from the package repositories
[bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).

### 1. Install conda

To start using conda, follow the [quick command line install
instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#quick-command-line-install)
to install the minimal conda installer
[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

### 2. Configure conda

Configure conda to access the package repositories (see also [bioconda
usage](https://bioconda.github.io/#usage)). This will modify your
`~/.condarc` file:

```{bash}
#| label: conda-configuration
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

::: {.callout-important}

Please note that the order of these commands is important!

:::

### 3. Create an isolated course environment

It is suggested you create and change to a isolated environment `pgip`
dedicated to the course:

```{bash }
#| label: create-conda-pgip
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
conda create -n pgip python=3.10 r-base
conda activate pgip
```

To deactivate an environment you issue the command `conda deactivate`.

### 4. Install packages

You can install packages as follows (remember to activate `pgip`!):

```{bash }
#| label: conda-install-packages
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
conda install bcftools angsd mosdepth
```

::: {.callout-tip}

If installation is slow, you can try the
[mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html) installer.
