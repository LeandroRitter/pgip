## On self-assessment exercise blocks

Scattered throughout the documents are exercise blocks, with hidden
answers, and in some cases, hints. The exercises are for
self-assessment of your understanding, but they are not mandatory.

Some of the exercises (labelled with the linux penguin {{< fa
brands linux >}}) are related to the usage of the command line
interfaces (CLI), and how to obtain information about what a program
does. This is an essential skill when working in Linux/UNIX
environments! These exercises can be skipped if you are an experienced
Linux/UNIX user.

An example exercise is provided here:

::: {.callout-exercise}

## Example exercise block

{{< fa brands linux >}} The `ls` command is used to list the contents
of a directory. What option provides a so-called long listing format?

::: {.callout-hint}

Type `ls --help` to show the options to `ls`.

:::

::: {.callout-answer}

The `-l` option uses the long listing format, i.e., the command to use
is `ls -l`.
