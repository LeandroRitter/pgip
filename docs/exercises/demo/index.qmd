# Exercise example {#sec-exercises-example}

::: {.callout-note}

Add the directory name to the pre-render script
`setup-exercise-data.sh` to link test data. If you want to setup your
own test data, you need to add a custom script and add it to the
quarto project file `_quarto.yml`. See [quarto pre and post
render](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/scripts.html#pre-and-post-render)
for more information.
