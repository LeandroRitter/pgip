# Variant calling {#sec-variantcalling}


## Best practice pipeline

Briefly describe best practice pipeline (e.g. GATK, bcftools,
freebayes), highlighting some of the problems with natural
populations:
- many workflows are human-centric and don't scale to non-model
  organisms (e.g. chromosome numbers in GATK)


## Variant calling exercise

````{tab-set-code}

```{code-block} shell
:name: bcftools
bcftools | head -2
```

```{code-block} shell
:name: gatk
gatk HaplotypeCaller
```

````

Optional: run bcftools / HaplotypeCaller / freebayes on data set or at
least show commands how files were generated
