# Data generation

## Sequencing protocols

What are the goals? To compile variation data for individuals. What are the issues?

- sampling
- sequencing cost
- lack of reference genomes (soon outdated)




### Individual sequencing

  - high-coverage sequencing
    - pros: comprehensive coverage
    - cons: until recently expensive, time-consuming
  - low-coverage sequencing @lou_BeginnerGuideLowcoverage_2021
	- pros: cost-efficient, better to sample many sites
	- cons: needs alternative analysis methods (likelihoods)

### pool sequencing

  - RADSeq [@davey_RADSeqNextgenerationPopulation_2010; @baird_RapidSNPDiscovery_2008]
