## The allozyme era

FIXME: picture of allozyme gel

### Development of genetic diversity measures

- *H* (*gene diversity*, *heterozygosity*): average proportion
  heterozygous loci
- *P* (*gene polymorphism*): average proportion polymorphic loci

## The nucleotide diversity era

## The population genomics era

# What is population genomics?

## What is population genomics?

Points from [@hahn_MolecularPopulationGenetics_2019]:

- whole-genome data instead of single loci - population genomics is
  population genetics for whole-genome sequences
  - if only this, not too exciting
- major promise: enables analyses not possible for single loci or that
  require genomic context
- addresses interactions between different forces, notably selection
  and demographic history

Some applications:

- genome-wide scans for selection
  - selection vs demography
- methods for genome-wide scans
- non-independence
  - different statistics rely on similar input
  - overlapping peaks from different statistics *not* independent

    ...highly consistent except for the very recent history,
    demonstrating the power of using whole-genome data.
